What we have accomplished
Akshobh: Created designs for the web and mobile apps
Daniel Abdelsamed: Created the typescript base for the API and made the DynamoDB table in AWS


What roadblocks occured
Akshobh: Deciding which prototyping tool to use from here on since the tool being used is soon set to expire
Daniel Abdelsamed: Getting typescript to work with ESLint was a challenge as support is relatively new


What we plan to do for the next sprint
Akshobh: Complete the web and mobile app template and final data fields in order to migrate to live workspace
Daniel Abdelsamed: Complete the API so that we can focus on the frontend


General discussion
The project is coming along nicely.
