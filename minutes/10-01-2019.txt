What we accomplished
Daniel: Created AWS infrastructure to allow for application to be deployed
Akshobh: Created designs for the web app and specified what data is to show up on each page
Alex: Created a global style sheet in order to be used and converted to react

What roadblocks occured
Daniel: Allowing all of the team members to access the account required me to setup AWS SSO to provide them with account access. This was an unforseen challenge that I had to overcome.
Akshobh: Coming up with the different form ideas was a challenge. Thinking about exactly what data needed to be submitted with each form was also more difficult than expected.
Alex: Trying to make the elements scale properly when the webpage changes sizes is difficult and required more work than expected.

What we plan to do for the next sprint
Daniel: Work on the API and create a deployment pipeline for the different apps
Akshobh: Create designs for the mobile app and continue refining the designs we have
Alex: Migrate the raw CSS over to React components

General discussion
- Helped get VSCode installed in the proper location (to allow `code .` to work in the terminal)
- Created the minutes folder for these minutes in the API repo
- Made VSCode the default file opener for files
